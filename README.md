## Description

A simple page containing some biographical information about me and linking you to my Dynamic Web Application projects.  The site will change over time as the semester progresses.

## Demo

Normally, this is where I would include a link to demo of the page.

## Details for Teaching Team

There is no login required for this site.  I linked to CSS Skeleton, Normalize and general Bootstrap CDNs with the intention of making the site appear neat and clean, and to make alignment and lists easier to work with.  I added some scripts for Adobe Edge fonts, and I used a tiny bit of PHP to show the current date in the header.  I borrowed the Harvard Extension School logo for the banner and added a picture of myself.
