			<h4>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h4>
			<p>I'm Shawn, and I am a fan of American black metal, an avid reader of Steven Erikson's <em>Malazan Book of the Fallen</em>, and an avant garde cook specializing in random mixes of what's left in the fridge. I work at Harvard Business School and I have a master's degree in philosophy.</p>
			<h4>Why are you taking this course?</h4>
			<p>I'm interested in a career path in technical writing. 'Technical writer' isn't an unambiguous job title, but in it's various forms and in different industries it often involves some degree of programming and/or web development skill. So, in taking this class I am hoping to improve my chances of finding work along this career path.</p>
			<h4>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h4>
			<p>Very little. I took CSCI E-12 in the summer so I feel fairly comfortable with a very small amount of programming in Java Script and PHP. But, from what I understand (and from what my experience thus far tells me) learning a programming language is not unlike learning formal logic, and I have quite a bit of training in formal logic. So, sometimes a bit of programming that I'm learning for the first time looks familiar to me, which can be an advantage.</p>
			<h4>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h4>
			<p>I am working on a Dell PC running Windows 10.</p>
			<h4>Anything else we should know?</h4>
			<p>When it's left up to me to arbitrarily name a project or site, I tend to pick terms from philosophy (specifically, metaphysics). This is why, for example, my class-devoted URL includes the term 'supervene'.</p>
